    Barrier(numqubits)

No-op operation that does not affect the quantum state or the execution of
a circuit, but prevents compression or optimization across it.

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> Barrier(1)
Barrier

julia> Barrier(2)
Barrier

julia> c = push!(Circuit(), Barrier(1), 1)
1-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── Barrier @ q[1]

julia> push!(c, Barrier(1), 1:3)
3-qubit circuit with 4 instructions:
├── Barrier @ q[1]
├── Barrier @ q[1]
├── Barrier @ q[2]
└── Barrier @ q[3]

julia> push!(c, Barrier(3), 1,2,3)
3-qubit circuit with 5 instructions:
├── Barrier @ q[1]
├── Barrier @ q[1]
├── Barrier @ q[2]
├── Barrier @ q[3]
└── Barrier @ q[1:3]
```
