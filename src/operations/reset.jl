    Reset()

Quantum operation that resets the status of one qubit to the ``\ket{0}``
state.

See also [`Operation`](@ref), [`Measure`](@ref).

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> Reset()
Reset

julia> c = push!(Circuit(), Reset, 1)
1-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── Reset @ q1

julia> push!(c, Reset(), 3)
3-qubit circuit with 2 instructions:
├── Reset @ q1
└── Reset @ q3
```
"""
struct Reset <: Operation{1,0} end

inverse(::Reset) = error("Cannot invert Reset operations")

opname(::Type{<:Reset}) = "Reset"

function Base.show(io::IO, ::Reset)
    print(io, opname(Reset))
end
