    Inverse(operation)

Inverse of the wrapped quantum operation.

The inversion is not performed right away, but only when the circuit is cached
or executed.

Some simplifications are already carried out at construction, for example,
`Inverse(Inverse(op))` is simplified as `Inverse(op)`.

!!! warn
    Users should not use directly `Inverse` but the `inverse` method, which
    performs already all the simplifications.

See also [`inverse`](@ref), [`iswrapper`](@ref), [`Control`](@ref),
[`Power`](@ref).

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> Inverse(GateX())
X†

julia> Inverse(GateH())
H†

julia> Inverse(GateSX())
SX†

julia> Inverse(GateCSX())
(CSX)†

julia> Inverse(QFT(4))
QFT†

```

## Decomposition

Decomposition of the inverse is carring out by inverting the decomposition of
the wrapped operation.

```jldoctests
julia> decompose(Inverse(GateCSX()))
2-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── H @ q2
```

struct Inverse{N,T<:AbstractGate{N}} <: AbstractGate{N}

    function Inverse(op::T) where {N,T<:AbstractGate{N}}
        new{N,T}(op)

    function Inverse{N,T}(args...; kwargs...) where {N,T<:AbstractGate{N}}
        new{N,T}(T(args...; kwargs...))

# this is an exception
