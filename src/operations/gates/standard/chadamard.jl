    GateCH()

Two qubit controlled-Hadamard gate.

!!! details
    Implemented as an alias to `Control(1, GateH())`.

!!! note
    By convention, the first qubit is the control and the second is the target.

## Matrix representation

```math
\operatorname{CH} = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
    0 & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{pmatrix}
```

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> GateCH(), numcontrols(GateCH), numtargets(GateCH)
(CH, 1, 1)

julia> matrix(GateCH())
4×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0        0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0        0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.707107   0.707107
 0.0  0.0  0.707107  -0.707107

julia> c = push!(Circuit(), GateCH(), 1, 2)
2-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── CH @ q1, q2

julia> power(GateCH(), 2), inverse(GateCH())
(C(H^2), CH)

```

## Decomposition

```jldoctests
julia> decompose(GateCH())
2-qubit circuit with 7 instructions:
├── S @ q2
├── H @ q2
├── T @ q2
├── CX @ q1, q2
├── T† @ q2
├── H @ q2
└── S† @ q2

```
"""
const GateCH = Control{1,1,2,GateH}

function decompose!(circ::Circuit, ::GateCH, qtargets, _)
    a, b = qtargets

    push!(circ, GateS(), b)
    push!(circ, GateH(), b)
    push!(circ, GateT(), b)
    push!(circ, GateCX(), a, b)
    push!(circ, GateTDG(), b)
    push!(circ, GateH(), b)
    push!(circ, GateSDG(), b)

    return circ
end
