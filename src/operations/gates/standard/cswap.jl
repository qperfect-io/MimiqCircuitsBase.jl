    GateCSWAP()

Three-qubit, controlled-``\operatorname{SWAP}`` gate.

!!! details
    Implemented as an alias to `Control{1,2,3,GateSWAP}`.

See also [`Control`](@ref), [`GateU`](@ref).

!!! note
    By convention, the first qubit is the control and the last two are
    targets.

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> GateCSWAP(), numcontrols(GateCSWAP()), numtargets(GateCSWAP())
(GateCSWAP(), 1, 2)

julia> matrix(GateCSWAP())
8×8 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0

 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0

julia> c = push!(Circuit(), GateCSWAP(), 1, 2, 3)
3-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── CSWAP @ q[1], q[2:3]

julia> power(GateCSWAP(), 2), inverse(GateCSWAP())
(Control(Parallel(2, GateID())), GateCSWAP())

```

## Decomposition

```jldoctests
julia> decompose(GateCSWAP())
3-qubit circuit with 3 instructions:
├── CX @ q[3], q[2]
├── C₂X @ q[1:2], q[3]
└── CX @ q[3], q[2]

```
"""
const GateCSWAP = typeof(Control(1, GateSWAP()))

@definename GateCSWAP "CSWAP"

function decompose!(circ::Circuit, ::GateCSWAP, qtargets, _, _)
    a, b, c = qtargets
    push!(circ, GateCX(), c, b)
    push!(circ, GateCCX(), a, b, c)
    push!(circ, GateCX(), c, b)
    return circ
