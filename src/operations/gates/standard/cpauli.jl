    GateCX()

Two qubit Controlled-``X`` gate (or CNOT).

!!! details
    Implemented as an alias to `Control(1, GateX())`.

!!! note
    By convention we refer to the first qubit as the control qubit and the
    second qubit as the target.

## Matrix representation

```math
\operatorname{CX} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
```

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> GateCX(), numcontrols(GateCX()), numtargets(GateCX())
(CX, 1, 1)

julia> matrix(GateCX())
4×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0  1.0
 0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0

julia> c = push!(Circuit(), GateCX(), 1, 2)
2-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── CX @ q[1], q[2]

julia> power(GateCX(), 2), inverse(GateCX())
(CID, CX)

```

## Decomposition

```jldoctests
julia> decompose(GateCX())
2-qubit circuit with 1 instructions:
└── CX @ q[1], q[2]

```

    GateCY()

Two qubit Controlled-``Y`` gate.

!!! details
    Implemented as an alias to `Control(1, GateY())`.

!!! note
    By convention we refer to the first qubit as the control qubit and the
    second qubit as the target.
