    inverse(circuit)
    inverse(instruction)
    inverse(operation)

Inverse of the given circuit, instruction or operation.

When the inverse is not a known operation, it will return an [`Inverse`](@ref)
object that wraps the original operation.

!!! details
    It throws an error if the object is not invertible. Such for example, in the
    case of non unitary operations, or circuits containing [`Measure`](@ref) or
    [`Reset`](@ref).

See also [`matrix`](@ref), [`isunitary`](@ref), [`power`](@ref).

## Examples

```jldoctests; setup = :(@variables λ)
julia> inverse(GateRX(λ))
RX(-λ)

julia> inverse(GateCSX())
C(SX†)
```
"""
function inverse end

"""
    power(operation, exponent)

Elevate an operation to a given exponent.

It performs simplifications when possible otherwise wraps the operation in
a [`Power`](@ref) object.

See also [`Power`](@ref), [`inverse`](@ref), [`Inverse`](@ref).

## Examples

```jldoctests
julia> power(GateX(), 1//2)
SX

julia> power(GateX(), 0.5)
X^0.5

julia> GateX()^2
ID

julia> GateCSX()^2
